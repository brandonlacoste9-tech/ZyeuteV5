## Slide 3: The Innovation

### Multi-Turn Reasoning Loop

**Traditional Automation:**

```
Script → Execute → Done
```

**Colony OS:**

```
Directive → Reason → Execute Tool → Observe → Reason Again → Execute → ... → Mission Complete
```

**Key Message:** "The system thinks between actions, adapting to results and making decisions autonomously."

## Slide 4: Google Cloud Integration

| Component       | Google Product      | Scale Tier Feature                     |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Queen Bee**   | **Cloud Run (GPU)** | Serverless, scales to zero             |
| **SWAT Bees**   | **Vertex AI**       | BigQuery grounding, zero-hallucination |
| **Infantry**    | **GKE Autopilot**   | Auto-scaling, managed nodes            |
| **Royal Vault** | **Secret Manager**  | Enterprise security                    |
| **Wax Ledger**  | **BigQuery**        | Unlimited analytics                    |

**Key Message:** "Every component is designed for Scale Tier deployment."
