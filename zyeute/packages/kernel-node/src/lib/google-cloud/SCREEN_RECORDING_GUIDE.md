## 🎤 Voiceover Script (Optional)

> "This is the Colony OS Mission Control Dashboard. Watch as I execute a directive to generate a podcast and deploy it. The Queen Bee reasons about the steps, the Scout harvests web data, the Wax-Builder writes the files, and the Siege Engine deploys—all autonomously. Notice the Emerald Glow when the mission completes. This is a self-governing digital organism running on Google Cloud."
