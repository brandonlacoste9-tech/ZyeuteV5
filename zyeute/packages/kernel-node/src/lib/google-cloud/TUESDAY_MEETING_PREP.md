# 🎯 Tuesday Meeting Prep - Google Cloud Scale Tier

**Date:** Tuesday, January 13, 2026  
**Attendees:** Jeremy, Unity, Brandon  
**Goal:** Secure $1,500+ credits (target: $350k AI Startup Tier)

## 🏛️ THE BILINGUAL HIVE - Your Secret Weapon

You've built something unique: **A system that speaks both "Sovereign" and "Enterprise" simultaneously.**

- **Sovereign:** Llama 4 Maverick (local/open-source reasoning)
- **Enterprise:** Google ADK (native Google agent framework)
- **Intelligence:** Automatic routing to the best agent for each task

**This is your differentiator.** Most companies use Google Cloud. You've built **on top of it** with native integration.

## 🎬 THE DAZZLE DEMO (2 Minutes)

### Quick Start

```powershell
cd zyeute\packages\kernel-node
.\google-cloud\run-dazzle-demo.ps1
```

### What It Shows

1. **Google ADK** - Native BigQuery analysis
2. **Hybrid Routing** - Smart agent selection
3. **Real-Time Telemetry** - BigQuery streaming
4. **Compute Continuum** - Local to cloud scaling

### Key Talking Points

- "We're not just using Google Cloud—we're using Google's native agent framework"
- "A task can start on your laptop and scale to 1,000 workers on GKE seamlessly"
- "Every action is logged to BigQuery in real-time for complete observability"

## 💡 ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "Why do you need $350k in credits?"

**A:** "We're building a production system that will process millions of tasks. The AI Startup Tier allows us to scale without worrying about infrastructure costs while we prove the business model."

### Q: "What makes this different from other agent systems?"

**A:** "We've built a 'Bilingual Hive'—it speaks both 'Sovereign' (local/open-source) and 'Enterprise' (Google native). The routing is automatic, and we can scale from a laptop to 1,000 workers seamlessly."

### Q: "How do you handle security?"

**A:** "We use Google Secret Manager for credentials, BigQuery for audit logs, and our Guardian Bee for real-time security monitoring. Every action is logged and traceable."

### Q: "What's your deployment timeline?"

**A:** "We're ready to deploy to Cloud Run and GKE Autopilot today. The infrastructure is production-ready, and we're just waiting on credits to scale."
