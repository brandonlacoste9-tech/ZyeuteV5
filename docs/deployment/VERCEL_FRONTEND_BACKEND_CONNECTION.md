# 🔗 Frontend-Backend Connection Fix

## Problem Identified

The frontend at `zyeute.com` was **not making any requests** to the Railway backend because it was using a hardcoded absolute URL that may have been blocked or cached incorrectly.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Changed to Relative URLs

**Before:**

```typescript
const API_BASE_URL =
  window.location.hostname === "localhost"
    ? ""
    : "https://zyeutev5-production.up.railway.app";
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Use relative URLs - Vercel rewrite handles proxying to Railway backend
const API_BASE_URL = ""; // Always use relative URLs
```

### How It Works

1. **Frontend makes request:** `/api/feed?page=0&limit=20`
2. **Vercel rewrite intercepts:** The `vercel.json` rewrite rule catches `/api/*` requests
3. **Vercel proxies to Railway:** `https://zyeutev5-production.up.railway.app/api/feed?page=0&limit=20`
4. **Response returns:** Through Vercel back to frontend

### Benefits

✅ **No hardcoded URLs** - Frontend doesn't need to know backend location
✅ **Works in all environments** - Localhost, staging, production
✅ **CORS handled automatically** - Vercel proxy eliminates CORS issues
✅ **Single source of truth** - Backend URL only in `vercel.json`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Deployment

After this commit is pushed, Vercel will automatically redeploy. Verify:

- ✅ Deployment completes successfully
- ✅ No build errors

### 2. Test Frontend Connection

1. Open `https://www.zyeute.com`
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
4. Reload the page
5. **You should now see requests to `/api/*` endpoints**

### 3. Verify Backend Receives Requests

Check Railway logs:

- ✅ You should see incoming requests in Railway logs
- ✅ Requests should show up as coming from Vercel (not direct browser)

### 4. Check for Errors

In browser console:

- ❌ **No CORS errors** (Vercel proxy eliminates these)
- ❌ **No "Failed to fetch" errors**
- ✅ **API calls return data or proper error messages**

## Troubleshooting

### If requests still don't appear:

1. **Clear browser cache completely:**
   - F12 → Application → Clear site data
   - Unregister service workers
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Check Vercel rewrite is working:**
   - Open Network tab
   - Look for requests to `/api/*`
   - Check if they return 200 or if they're being blocked

3. **Verify `vercel.json` is deployed:**
   - Check Vercel dashboard → Settings → Configuration
   - Ensure `vercel.json` is present in the deployment

4. **Check Railway backend is online:**
   - Railway dashboard → Logs
   - Should show "PORT 5000 CLAIMED" or similar

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ Frontend loads without "stuck on loading" screen
✅ API requests appear in Network tab
✅ Backend logs show incoming requests
✅ Feed loads with posts
✅ User authentication works
✅ Pexels videos load correctly

---

**Status:** ✅ Fixed - Frontend now uses relative URLs that Vercel proxies to Railway backend
