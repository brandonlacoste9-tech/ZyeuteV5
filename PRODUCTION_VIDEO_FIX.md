# 🛡️ Production Video Fix - TikTok Feed

**Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Issue:** Videos not playing in production (Railway/Vercel builds)  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### **1. Missing Production Video Attributes**
- **Issue:** Video elements missing `muted` and `playsInline` HTML attributes
- **Impact:** Browsers block autoplay in production without these attributes
- **Fix:** Added both attributes to video elements

### **2. Case Sensitivity (Not an Issue Here)**
- **Status:** ✅ No static video files found in `public/`
- **Note:** All videos are dynamically generated/loaded from URLs (FAL/Kling)

### **3. Import vs Reference (Not an Issue Here)**
- **Status:** ✅ No video imports found in code
- **Note:** All videos use URL references (correct approach)

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### **Fix 1: AIStudio Video Element**
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/AIStudio.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<video
  src={generatedVideo}
  controls
  autoPlay
  loop
  className="w-full"
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<video
  key={generatedVideo} // Force re-render if source changes
  src={generatedVideo}
  controls
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted // CRITICAL for production
  playsInline // CRITICAL for iOS production
  className="w-full"
>
  <source src={generatedVideo} type="video/mp4" />
  Votre navigateur ne supporte pas la balise vidéo.
</video>
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `muted` attribute (required for autoplay)
- ✅ Added `playsInline` attribute (required for iOS)
- ✅ Added `<source>` tag with type (better browser compatibility)
- ✅ Added `key` prop for proper re-rendering

### **Fix 2: VideoPlayer Component**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/features/VideoPlayer.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<video
  ref={videoRef}
  src={effectiveSrc}
  poster={poster}
  playsInline
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
  preload={preload}
  // muted was only set via JS useEffect
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<video
  ref={videoRef}
  src={effectiveSrc}
  poster={poster}
  playsInline // CRITICAL for iOS production
  muted={muted} // CRITICAL - now as HTML attribute
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
  preload={preload}
/>
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `muted={muted}` as HTML attribute (was only set via JS)
- ✅ Ensures muted state is set before browser autoplay policy checks

---

## 🎯 Why These Fixes Matter

### **1. `muted` Attribute**
- **Why:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) block autoplay with sound
- **Production Impact:** Without `muted` as an HTML attribute, autoplay is blocked
- **JS-only Setting:** Setting `muted` via JS happens AFTER the browser checks autoplay policy

### **2. `playsInline` Attribute**
- **Why:** iOS Safari requires this for inline video playback
- **Without It:** iOS tries to open video in fullscreen, breaking TikTok-style feed
- **Production Impact:** Critical for mobile TikTok-style experience

### **3. `key` Prop (AIStudio)**
- **Why:** Forces React to unmount/remount video when source changes
- **Without It:** Browser might cache old video source, causing playback issues
- **Production Impact:** Ensures clean video loading in continuous scroll

---

## ✅ Vite Configuration Check

**File:** `vite.config.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **Correctly Configured**

- ✅ `public/` folder is automatically served at root (`/`)
- ✅ Build output: `dist/public` (correct for Vercel)
- ✅ No custom optimizations that would break video serving

**Vite automatically:**
- Serves files from `frontend/public/` at root URL (`/`)
- Copies public assets during build
- Preserves file structure

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Before Deploy:**
- [x] Video has `muted` attribute
- [x] Video has `playsInline` attribute
- [x] No video file imports (only URL references)
- [x] Vite config correct

### **After Deploy (Production):**
- [ ] Test autoplay in Chrome (desktop)
- [ ] Test autoplay in Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Test autoplay in Firefox
- [ ] Test TikTok-style feed scrolling
- [ ] Test video generation → upload → feed flow

---

## 🚀 Production Verification Steps

### **1. Network Tab Check:**
```
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Filter by "Media"
3. Generate video in Studio
4. Check for:
   - ✅ Status 200 (not 404)
   - ✅ Content-Type: video/mp4
   - ✅ Video loads and plays automatically
```

### **2. Console Check:**
```
Look for:
- ❌ "Autoplay prevented" warnings
- ❌ CORS errors
- ❌ 404 errors on video sources
```

### **3. iOS Test:**
```
1. Open on iPhone Safari
2. Scroll feed
3. Video should:
   - ✅ Play inline (not fullscreen)
   - ✅ Auto-play when scrolled into view
   - ✅ Loop continuously
```

## 📊 Files Changed

1. ✅ `frontend/src/pages/AIStudio.tsx`
   - Added `muted` and `playsInline` to generated video preview

2. ✅ `frontend/src/components/features/VideoPlayer.tsx`
