You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, React.js, React Router, TanStack Query, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code.
- Use functional programming patterns; **avoid classes**.
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Organize files systematically: exported components, helpers, static content, and types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Use PascalCase for component filenames (e.g., `AuthWizard.tsx`).
- Favor named exports for functions.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer **interfaces** over types for extendability.
- Avoid enums; use `const` objects (maps) or literal unions for better type safety.
- Use **React Functional Components** with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Always use **React Hooks** (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) correctly; never use class components.

UI and Styling
- Use **ShadCN UI** (built on Radix UI) and **Tailwind CSS** for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a *mobile-first* approach.
- Use `lucide-react` for icons.

Performance Optimization
- Leverage **TanStack Query** (`useQuery`, `useMutation`) for server state management.
- Wrap asynchronous components in `React.Suspense` with a fallback UI.
- Use simple `lazy()` loading for non-critical routes.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data.

Key Conventions
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Ensure strictly **NO WHITE SCREENS**: Always handle loading and error states gracefully with UI feedback.
