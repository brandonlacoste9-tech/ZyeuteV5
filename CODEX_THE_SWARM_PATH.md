# CODEX: THE SWARM PATH

**Protocol Level:** 0 (Foundational)
**Status:** ACTIVATED
**Philosophy:** "E Pluribus Unum" (Out of many Hives, One Colony)

---

## 1. The Federated Hive Architecture

We reject the monolith. We build **Hives**, not just apps.

- **The Hives (The Bodies):**
  - **Zyeuté:** The Social Hive (Quebec).
  - **AdGen:** The Commercial Hive.
  - **Future Sites:** Distinct identities, distinct domains, distinct user bases.
  - _Role:_ They generate **Nectar** (Data, Revenue, Interaction).

- **The Colony (The Mind):**
  - **Definition:** The centralized Python Kernel (Colony OS).
  - _Role:_ It consumes Nectar to generate **Royal Jelly** (Intelligence, Optimization, Security).
  - _Relation:_ The Colony is the "Backplane" of the internet of Hives. It does not live _in_ the site; the site plugs _into_ it.

## 2. The Nervous System (The Synapse)

- **The Link:** Node.js Frontends (Skins) communicate with the Python Backend (Kernel) via the **Synapse Protocol** (gRPC/Secure HTTP).
- **Authority:** The Kernel operates with **Service Role** (God Mode) privileges but acts through distinct **Bee Agents** for accountability.
- **Isolation:** A crash in the Zyeuté Skin does not kill the Colony. A restart of the Colony does not kill the Zyeuté Skin (it just pauses intelligence).

## 3. The Rituals of the Void

- **The Burn:** Ephemerality is law.
  - **Time Fuse:** `expires_at`
  - **Eye Fuse:** `view_count` >= `max_views`
  - **Social Fuse (Tribunal):** Trusted Elders can accelerate the burn via "Rot" signals.
- **The Scar:**
  - Content is **Incinerated** (Nullified).
  - Metadata is **Archived** (The Scar).
  - _The Void Remembers:_ The Colony learns from what was burned, ensuring the organism evolves.

## 4. Regional Membranes (HiveEnum)

- **Structure:** Hives are segmented by **Region** (Quebec, Mexico, South).
- **Permeability:** Semi-permeable. Users live in their membrane but can "Travel" (Search) across borders.
- **Biodiversity:** The Swarm Presence is maintained by **Worker Bees** (Digital Biodiversity) that curate and organize regional clusters, ensuring no Hive feels empty.

## 5. The Interface (Ti-Guy Protocol)

- **Rule #1:** The User never sees the Python Kernel.
- **Rule #2:** The User only speaks to **Ti-Guy** (or the Hive-specific Guide).
- **Translation:** All system states (Errors, Burns, Success) are translated into the local dialect/persona before rendering.
  - _Raw:_ `Error 500: Burn Failed`
  - _Translated:_ "Le match a mouillé, boss. On réessaie."
