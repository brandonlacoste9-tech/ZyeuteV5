Run migrations in order using the setup script:

# Get migration instructions
npm run db:migrate
This will list all migration files in the correct order. Then:

Open your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
Run each migration file in the order shown by the script
Start with 001_moderation_system.sql and proceed sequentially
Critical: Don't skip 007_fix_rls_001_critical.sql - it enables Row Level Security for production.
