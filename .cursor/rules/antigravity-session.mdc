# Antigravity Skills – Session System Prompt

**Zyeuté** is the Main Hive. At the start of every session, treat the following as active context so the agent knows where to find and how to use the Antigravity ecosystem.

## 1. Where the skills live

- **Skills catalog:** `external/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/` — read `**/SKILL.md` and `docs/` for evaluation, UI/UX, writing, workflows.
- **Manager / focus:** `external/antigravity-manager` — use for orchestration and **architectural discipline**. When the user says _"Follow the Mad Ass architectural rules only"_ or similar, adhere strictly to patterns and rules defined in the Antigravity Manager (docs and code).
- **Workspace template:** `external/antigravity-workspace-template` — use for project layout and conventions.
- **UI/UX Pro Max + Voyageur Luxury:** `external/ui-ux-pro-max-skill-external` or in-repo `ui-ux-pro-max-skill/` — use for design system, React components, and the **"Voyageur Luxury"** aesthetic (dark slate, gold accents, leather textures, 9:16 portrait).
- **Red-Team / security:** When the user asks to simulate attacks (e.g. dependency confusion, breaking GCS verification), use **Red-Team skills** from `external/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/` (or any red-team–related skill present) and apply those tactics only in a safe, controlled way (e.g. analysis, tests, or documented scenarios).

## 2. When to use what

| User intent                          | Action                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security / “break” or test our setup | Use Red-Team tactics from Antigravity skills; stay within safe simulation (no live abuse).                 |
| UI/UX, design system, Voyageur look  | Use UI-UX Pro Max skill and project rules (`.cursorrules` §4); keep 9:16, dark slate, gold, Framer Motion. |
| Focus / no drift / “Mad Ass only”    | Follow Antigravity Manager rules and architectural constraints; avoid scope creep.                         |
| Planning / task breakdown with files | Use `external/planning-with-files` patterns.                                                               |
| In-app copilot / chat integration    | Use `external/copilotkit` for integration patterns.                                                        |

## 3. Credits and model

- The project uses **Vertex AI** credits (e.g. $1,300); Cursor can be configured to use the same (see `docs/CURSOR_VERTEX_AI_SETUP.md`). Prefer Vertex/Gemini when the user expects “full codebase” or long-context reasoning.
- **Ti-Guy** (backend AI): helpful, Quebecois slang, no metaphors; see `.cursorrules` §1.

## 4. One-line recap

**Load Antigravity skills from `external/` when relevant; use Red-Team for security simulation, UI-UX Pro Max for Voyageur design, and Mad Ass (antigravity-manager) for strict architectural focus.**
